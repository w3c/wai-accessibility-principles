    ```
    Content does not cause seizures and physical reactions
    ```

  * Sentence and list added. Was:

    ```
    Content that flashes at certain rates or patterns can cause photosensitive reactions, including seizures. Flashing content is ideally avoided entirely or only used in a way that does not cause known risks.
    ```

    now:

    ```
    Content that flashes at certain rates or patterns can cause photosensitive reactions, including seizures. Flashing content is ideally avoided entirely or only used in a way that does not cause known risks. Also animations and moving content can cause discomfort and physical reactions.
  
    Examples of avoiding causing seizures and physical reactions:
    - Do not include content that flashes at particular rates and patterns
    - Warn users before flashing content is presented, and provide alternatives
    - Provide mechanisms to switch off animations, unless they are essential
    ```

* New section added â€“ including heading, paragraphs, list, and 2 subsections:  
  **[Users can use different input modalities beyond keyboard](/fundamentals/accessibility-principles/#modalities)**
